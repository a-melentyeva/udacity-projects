# udacity-projects-SleepQualityApp

An app for tracking sleeping data (such as date, length and self-evaluated sleep quality).
This app was built as a learning process in the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course on Udacity (created by Google).
Implements some features using Room & Coroutines, architechture loosely based off of MVVM.
This project was also my first take on RecyclerView.
